# Legacy Structures Processing

This phase plans the migration of legacy structure assets into a stable, reproducible MP1 structure layer.

## Special requirement

- Preserve and document the existing legacy structure organization so it can be recreated when needed.

## Outputs for this phase

- `inventory.md`: structure hierarchy and asset types.
- `migration_plan.md`: staged migration strategy for structure assets.
- `execution_checklist.md`: restart-safe, task-by-task checklist.
