# Legacy Processing

This directory tracks incremental migration of legacy work into reproducible MP1 pipelines.

## Approach

- Process one legacy area at a time.
- Keep each area small, scoped, and testable.
- Write an inventory first, then a migration plan, then extraction tasks.

## Workstream order

1. `01-tools/`
2. `02-structures/` (planned)
3. `03-calculations/` (planned)
4. `04-analysis/` (planned)
5. `05-paper-assets/` (planned)

## Status

- Active: `01-tools/`
- Next: `02-structures/` (scaffolded)
