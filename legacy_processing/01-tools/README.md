# Legacy Tools Processing

This phase defines how legacy tooling is stabilized and mapped into MP1 micro-paper workflows.

## Goals

- Identify which tools are still required.
- Separate external binaries from project-owned scripts.
- Define a minimal maintained toolchain for MP1 execution.

## Outputs for this phase

- `inventory.md`: current tool inventory and classification.
- `migration_plan.md`: stepwise migration and validation plan.
- `execution_checklist.md`: session-safe checklist for job-by-job progress and handoff.
