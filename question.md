# MP01: Investigate Strain

## Research question

Why is poly-axis analysis required to correctly determine interface behavior, and why does single-axis analysis miss key effects in strain, structural response, electronic response, and magnetic response?

## Success criteria

- Produce a reproducible poly-axis vs single-axis comparison workflow from legacy and active data.
- Generate manuscript-ready outputs covering all four effect classes: strain, structural, electronic, magnetic.
- Write a standalone mini-paper section that states and supports the poly-axis requirement claim.

## Scope notes

- This micro-paper builds on existing papers in `paper/library/`.
- Legacy outputs are preserved in `legacy_import/` for traceability.
